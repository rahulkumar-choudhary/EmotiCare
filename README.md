# **EmotiCare: AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot**

## **Inspiration**  
Mental health is often stigmatized, and many people hesitate to talk about their struggles. We wanted to create a safe, AI-powered space where users can express their emotions anonymously, receive support, and access mental health resources. Inspired by the potential of AI in mental health care, we built **EmotiCare**—a chatbot that listens, understands, and guides users towards appropriate help.

## **What it does**  
**EmotiCare** is an AI-driven web application designed to:  
✅ Provide **24/7 emotional support** through an AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini API.  
✅ Detect **emotional tone** and adjust responses accordingly using **NLP**.  
✅ Perform **facial emotion detection** to better understand user mood.  
✅ Summarize the **conversation** and classify potential mental health concerns.  
✅ Offer **personalized coping techniques**, mindfulness exercises, and self-help strategies.  
✅ Recommend **nearby therapists, support groups, and helplines** based on location.  
✅ Allow users to **book appointments** or let the AI notify a mental health professional on their behalf.  
✅ Redirect users to **human counselors** if severe distress is detected.  

## **How we built it**  
🚀 **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini API for chatbot, OpenCV for facial emotion detection  
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing conversations and user preferences)  
- **APIs:** Google Maps API (for finding nearby therapists)  

🔨 **Development Steps:**  
1. Integrated **Google Gemini API** to build an NLP-powered chatbot.  
2. Used **OpenCV** for facial emotion detection.  
3. Designed a **Flask-based web interface** with an intuitive UI.  
4. Developed a **mental health resource finder** using geolocation.  
5. Implemented a **therapy booking system** with user consent.  
6. Ensured **privacy and security** by anonymizing user data.  

## **Challenges we ran into**  
😟 **Fine-tuning AI responses** – Ensuring that the chatbot provided empathetic and context-aware replies was challenging.  
🤖 **Facial emotion detection accuracy** – Building a robust system to detect subtle emotions was difficult, as lighting and angles affected accuracy.  
📍 **Finding reliable mental health resources** – We had to ensure that recommendations were **accurate, relevant, and verified**.  
🛡 **Privacy concerns** – Since mental health is sensitive, we took extra steps to ensure **user anonymity and data security**.  

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**  
🎉 Successfully built a **functional AI chatbot** that provides emotional support.  
🎉 Integrated **real-time facial emotion detection** with OpenCV.  
🎉 Created a **user-friendly web application** accessible to anyone.  
🎉 Ensured **privacy-first design** to maintain user trust.
